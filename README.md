# LikeHome

## Description
LikeHome is our main project for CMPE165 @ SJSU. It is is a web / mobile application which shares catalog of ideas.  LikeHome is a 
mini clone of the very successful website hotel.com. Using LikeHome, users will have the opportunity to create an account and search for / reserve hotels
of their choosing. Their search can be filtered and sorted using various criteria, such as (_____). They will also be able to cancel or edit current reservations and
gather reward points to use for free reservations. 

## Goal
Our goal is to provide a quick and easy way for users to find hotels that fit their preferred price range and destination all in one application.

## How to run

If you use fish this is a nice nvm manager https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish

uses Node 18.9

``` npm install ```

``` npm start ```

## Notes and Quirks to organize later

React has a weird property called strict mode you can read about here https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html
but one thing to understand is that in the dev build this means component code is run twice, so if some api call is being
called twice it is most likely due too strict mode
